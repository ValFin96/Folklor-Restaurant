# Folklor-Restaurant

## Description

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to book reservations for a restaurant. The front-end is built using React, providing a polished and responsive user interface that accepts and responds to user input. The back-end is powered by a Node.js and Express.js server, and optionally incorporates GraphQL for handling queries and mutations, or can use Express routes for those functionalities. Data is stored in a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM, allowing for easy retrieval, addition, updating, and deletion of reservations.

The application includes authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access and protect sensitive API key information on the server. A clean and organized file structure, standardized naming conventions for classes and IDs, proper indentation, and high-quality comments have been used to meet quality coding standards. The application has been deployed on Heroku and links can be found below.
